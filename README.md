# Tryke

Tryke is a social app with the goal of uniting your local communities, schduling local events, and making plans when it seems almost too late. Using your local area, our forum allows you to keep in touch with people in the immediate area, which is great for putting together events quickly, and smoothly. Our API saves posts, and allows for other web apps to connect with our app, and vice versa. In future concepting, our team hopes to make our app more of a one stop shop for your local area, using event related APIs we plan to allow users to browse local events held by local buisnesses, and venues. Which would be great for allowing a certain area to seriously florish with activity.
